Configures Firebase for this app: Android, Flutter Web, and the messaging
service worker, from one Firebase project.

Usage: dart run eigen_firebase:configure_firebase [options]

  --project <id>     The Firebase project to configure against. Omit it and
                     FlutterFire asks, which is also where a project can be
                     created. Once configured, the project already recorded in
                     firebase.json is reused.
  --account <email>  The Google account to authenticate as, for a machine
                     signed in to more than one.
  --worker <dir>     The Cloudflare Worker beside this app, so its
                     wrangler.jsonc receives FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID. A combined
                     project passes ../server; an app-only repository omits it.
  --help             Show this.

Platforms are not an option: the app is Android and Web, and the service worker
configuration this writes comes from the Web app. Run `flutterfire configure`
directly for anything this does not cover.''';

/// The options this command takes.
///
/// A deliberately narrow interface rather than a passthrough. This command
/// exists to configure a generated app the one way it is supported, and the
/// options that would change that, `--platforms` above all, leave the rest of
/// the script unable to finish: it needs the Web app FlutterFire records, and
/// fails several steps later if it is not there.
///
/// `project` and `account` are forwarded to `flutterfire configure`; `worker`
/// is this command's own, and names a directory FlutterFire has no notion of.
