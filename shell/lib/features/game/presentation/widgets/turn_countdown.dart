/// Styled countdown toward [deadline].
///
/// Shows remaining time as "12m 34s" or "45s". Turns [ColorScheme.error]
/// when under 60 seconds. Returns an empty widget once the deadline has
/// passed.
///
/// When the device is offline the countdown freezes at the last known value
/// and renders with a pause icon in [ColorScheme.onSurfaceVariant] so the
/// player knows the timer is not draining locally (though the server clock
/// continues).
///
/// Provide [style] to override the default [TextTheme.bodySmall], useful
/// when the countdown should be larger (e.g. inside the game screen).
///
/// [deadline] is an absolute server timestamp in epoch milliseconds, converted
/// here against the synchronized server clock; otherwise a device with a skewed
/// clock would show a countdown that disagrees with when the turn actually
/// expires.
///
/// Provide [windowMillis] (how long the turn was when it began) to enable the
/// soft-deadline margin: the countdown reaches zero slightly before the true
/// deadline so an on-time submit survives network latency. The margin is capped
/// to a fraction of the window so a short one, a three-second reaction window,
/// is not swallowed whole. Omit it (e.g. on at-a-glance home cards) for a
/// truthful, unmargined countdown.
///
