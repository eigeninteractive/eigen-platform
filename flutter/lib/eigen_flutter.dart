/// ```dart
/// import 'package:eigen_flutter/eigen_flutter.dart';

/// Future<void> main() => runEngineApp(

/// This library is the supported app import. It exposes the entry point,
/// composition-root configuration, game contract, wire vocabulary, and shared
/// game UI without exposing the app shell's repositories or transport.
///
/// Start with the
/// [EigenInteractive quickstart](https://eigeninteractive.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
/// and use the
/// [task guides](https://eigeninteractive.com/docs/build-a-game/the-contract)
/// for end-to-end TypeScript and Dart examples.

/// name a [GameStatus] or an [OutcomeResultEnum] without depending on
/// `eigen_api` itself, which is a build artifact that `tool/generate_api.sh`
/// deletes and rewrites wholesale.
///
/// Listed explicitly rather than exported wholesale so the generated `*Api`
/// classes and their Dio plumbing stay out of an app's namespace: naming a type
/// is part of the contract, calling the server is not.
