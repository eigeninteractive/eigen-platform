/// Schema version 1 of Rock–Paper–Scissors on the client: the Dart twin of
/// the same-named TypeScript unit in
/// `eigen-server/examples/rps/src/module/v1.ts`.
///
/// The two halves split by authority, not by feature. The TS unit owns
/// everything that decides anything: `initialState`, `applyAction`,
/// `applyLifecycle`, `computeObservation`, and the Zod `schemas`. This unit
/// owns the codec, the legality check that greys out an illegal tap, the
/// optimism contract, and the rendering. Where the two overlap (legality, the
/// two predicates) they are transcriptions, and the shared fixtures under
/// `example/fixtures/v1/` are what keeps them transcriptions.
///
/// A version unit never branches on version. When the rules change
/// incompatibly, copy this file to `v2/`, change it there, and add the entry to
/// [RpsModule.versions]; matches created under v1 keep loading through this
/// unit until they drain.

  /// The reason is the game itself. `computeObservation` masks the opponent's
  /// pending status as well as their commit, so after you throw you genuinely
  /// do not know which of two futures you are in: the opponent has not thrown
  /// yet (your next frame just echoes `yourMove`), or they threw first and
  /// your throw resolves the round (your next frame is a full reveal with a
  /// new score). Predicting either one would be wrong half the time, and a
  /// prediction that is wrong half the time is worse than no prediction: it
  /// shows a reveal that never happened.
  ///
  /// That masking is also what makes simultaneous play work at all: because
  /// the opponent's hidden commit does not change your projected view, the
  /// engine's same-view rule lets both submissions land in either order
  /// without one losing an optimistic-lock race.

  /// widget state and resolves it against the
