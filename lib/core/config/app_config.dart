/// - [branding]: user-facing identity (name, theme seed).
/// - [engine]: runtime backend/integration values the framework needs.
///
/// Keeping each concern as its own value object is what stops this from
/// decaying into a junk drawer of unrelated flags. A consuming app reads its
/// public build-time values from Dart compilation environment declarations and
/// passes them in here, so the framework remains independent of how the app is

  /// `auth.mygame.com` beside `mygame.com`. Setting this to a host Firebase
  /// Hosting does not answer for breaks web sign-in outright, which is why it
