///    single-attempt, so if a bot's turn is never delivered the only thing that
///    resolves the game is the turn deadline firing the server's alarm. Untimed

/// experience, and the server accepts it - the game simply comes out unrated,
/// since rating requires a registered account.

/// deployment from showing a solo entry that opens a dead-end picker.

/// bots in general, because the deferred offline-solo path will not share it: a
/// client-driven bot has no dispatch to fail, so an on-device game can be
/// untimed. When that lands, this becomes a choice between two solo modes
