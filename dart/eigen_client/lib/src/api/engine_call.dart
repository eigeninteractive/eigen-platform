/// answering `{ error, code? }`, and the stable `code` survives onto
/// [EngineException.code] for callers and `humanize` to dispatch on. A failure
/// with no response (connection refused, DNS, timeout, a cancelled request)
/// propagates untouched, preserving the distinction between "the server said
/// no" and "the outcome is unknown". That difference matters for a
/// state-changing command: a rejected move did not happen, whereas a timed-out
/// one may well have landed.
