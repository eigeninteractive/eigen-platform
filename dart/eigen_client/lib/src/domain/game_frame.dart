/// parsed observation, the optimistic-lock version, the players whose turn is
/// active, and the turn timing. Rebuilt on every frame the game socket emits.
///
/// The parsed game config is deliberately not part of the frame. It is parsed
/// once from the immutable game config and lives for the whole game, so it is
/// a separate, longer-lived concern carried alongside the frame (see
/// `gameConfigProvider` and [GameContentContext.config]) rather than
/// re-bundled into every snapshot.
///
/// Frames arrive as an ordered, gap-recovered stream (observations are
/// append-only server-side, and a reconnect replays whatever versions the
/// socket missed), so a game may animate the transition between consecutive frames
/// and trust that it sees every one, falling back to a snap only after a
/// cold (re)load, where no predecessor was rendered.
